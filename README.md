# DisEditor - A low noise text editor  @;-)
Aiming at being visually clean, but with nice features.

## Description
This will be a text editor that aims at being a low noise, distraction free text editor, inspired by [Sioyek PDF Reader](https://github.com/ahrm/sioyek) and by [Zettlr](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr). <br>
<br>
The idea is to make it as easy as possible to put your thoughts into words and to develop your thoughts. Work on them as you write, edit, think and rewrite, the different parts of your text that represents in the written word, your thoughts and your ideas, in a cohesive body of words. <br>
<br>
I'm making this tool for me and for my daughter. I will be sharing it in here with a Open Source License, in the hope that it could be useful to other persons. <br>

## The technologies that I plan to use

1. Tauri

2. TypeScript

3. Rust

4. Vue.js

5. CodeMirror 6.0

6. Node.js

7. ...and possibly same Javascript
